In this phase, we are going to write a proposal. After implementing SLAM on Eddie, it will be time to implement your proposed idea and leverage SLAM in it. You can choose from different topics such as:

- Reinforcement Learning
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- Computer Vision and Image Processing
- Social and Cognitive Robotics
- Industrial Robotics
- Behavior-based Robotics
- ROS2 Libraries
- Autonomous Navigation
- Real-time Robotics
- SLAM
- and a ton of other subjects\...

Choose your proposal and present it in the form of one and a half to two pages along with the a short introduction of the previous work done in this topic. This phase is an exercise for writing a literature review or review of previous works, which is one of the first steps of a research work.

# Exercise 1

Refer to the links below and learn how to write this part of the research.

- [QUT: How to write a literature review](https://www.citewrite.qut.edu.au/write/writing-well/literview.html)

- [University of Edinburgh: Literature review](https://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-academic-development/study-hub/learning-resources/literature-review)
- Other resources \...

# Exercise 2

- Search in Google Scholar and similar sites as well as code repositories. As you search and refine you ideas, you will narrow down your keywords.
- Eddie has RGBD sensor and IR/Ultrasonic point sensors. You can see an example of the use of this robot [here ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIdyXZ5SBSs).
- Head to the docs folder of  [eddie](https://github.com/arashsm79/eddiebot-ros) repository and get yourself familiar with its capabilities and different parts. 
- Read the articles located in the docs folder.
- You can use Boolean operators and other search methods to search in Google Scholar. [This tutorial](https://library.acg.edu/how-to-guides/google-scholar/advanced-searching) has a good explanation of different ways to search better in google scholar. for example:

```
"reinforcement learning" ("ros2" OR "ros 2") "depth"
```


# Exercise 3

Write your group proposal in one and a half to two pages. All references used must be cited.
The use of LLMs is recommended.
